Some tutorial materials for learning galsim, made for SURF (Caltech/JPL) 2022 students

To get started:
1. Pick your favorite spot for repositories (I use `~/HOME/repos/`) and go there
2. Clone the repo! (`https://github.com/sweverett/SURF-galsim-tutorial.git`)
3. Build the conda env from the `env.yaml` file: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
4. Activate: `conda activate galsim-tutorial`
5. Open the first notebook: `jupyter lab getting-started.ipnb`

While we will view our output fits files in python, you may also want to use & get familiar with DS9.
